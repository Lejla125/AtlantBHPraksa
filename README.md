Smoke_test sheet contains two test cases testing the main purpose of Navigator namely the search bar where you can either search for a place or a street name. The regression_suite sheet contains test cases for basic user flows, including negative and positive test cases, whereas bugs_improvements sheet contains some improvement suggestions.
